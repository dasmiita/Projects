# Hospital Management System

Hi! This is a Hospital Management System I worked on for a project at university.
I tried my best to design it to simulate a basic hospital management system. It includes:
- A module file: Contains all the core functions and SQL integration for interacting with a locally stored database.
- A main file: Calls the module functions to implement the hospital management system's functionality.
